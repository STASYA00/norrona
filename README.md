<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

  Norrona is one of the most famous Scandinavian brands selling ski and snowboard clothing. Not only do they produce garments and accessories of high quality, but also pay close attention to the [sustainability aspect](https://www.norrona.com/sv-SE/om-norrona/socialt-och-miljoansvar/). This is one of the factors that makes me - as well as many others around the world - trust the company: you can be sure you are contributing to making this world a better place when buying their products. However, not all of us can afford buying Norrona jackets at full price. For that the company has made an outlet: a selection of products can be bought at reduced price, which makes sustainable functional design clothes more accessible to the general public.

  The challenge with the outlet is that (as it ~~always~~ often happens) most common sizes are available for a very short period of time. These products are usually sold as soon as they appear on the webpage (or at least it seems so). To overcome this issue I have developed a tool that monitors the outlet and notifies the user when the product of his size is available:)
